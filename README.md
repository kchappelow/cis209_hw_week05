#Homework Assignment Week 5 - Due 10/11/2017 7:15 p.m.
Decimal to Hex, Area of a hexagon

Task #1: Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer between 0 and 15 and displays its corresponding hex number.
Here is a sample run:

```
Enter a decimal value (0 to 15): 11
The hex value is B
```

Task #2: Write a program that prompts the user to enter the side of a hexagon and displays its area.
The area of a hexagon can be computed using the following formula (**s** is the length of a side):

```
Area = (6 * s * s) / (4 * tan(PI/6))
```

Be sure to use the math functions for squaring s, PI, and the tangent.

Example run:


```
Enter the side: 5.5
The area of the hexagon is 78.59
```

Task #3: Submit the homework using git.
